The 21st century brings humanity the most exciting challenges ever. These need more than ever for us to realize the fundamental truth that the ‘World is one family.’ As the Information economy takes centre stage with smartphones, the internet, web3 and Artificial intelligence, changes for an efficient information economy with a global outlook are necessary.

Humanity has the opportunity to feel with vivid emotions the truth that we are alone. As we gain the courage to dream across the universe, our differences of colour, race, languages, religion seem all too petty. Our fear of each other is the only existential risk for releasing the adventures of a lifetime for our species. As we build a global ecosystem, we understand our Indian roots and what role she has to play in humanity’s future?

Geographically, it’s paramount that India becomes a global hub for creators, artists and philosophers, being the world’s largest democracy and soon to be the world’s most populated country. Every corner of India has a story to tell. Speaking the global English language, with millennials of culture, history and philosophy, India must host the world.
As international travel becomes cheaper over the coming decade, the land of Spirituality must help each like a mother and play the most crucial role of enabling actors in the drama of Maya.

Today’s capital markets are global and have been rewarding projects that continue to grow and build. As more and more people become independent of their physical location to earn a living, many more would travel, explore and come closer to themselves, possibly build a life being true to their heart.

At Zo World, we want to build a global travel ecosystem that helps humanity travel, live and work from anywhere in the world. On the other hand, this is possible by determined individuals willing to build their regions. Therefore, we are building a community-led platform that allows people to participate and develop their local travel economies.
Global digital nomads are showing the future of travelling is just living and working like a local. With our experience of hosting over a million travellers from 150+ countries, we know that all you need are local friends, and you can live fearlessly anywhere in the world.

We are solving travel. We will make it possible for anyone to travel, live and work from anywhere in the world. Even today, we do such. It costs money, but it’s safe, personalized, serendipitous and possibly leaves you with something that money can never buy, a life following your heart. \z/
